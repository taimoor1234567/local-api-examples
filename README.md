# Kameleo Local API Example Codes
With [Kameleo](https://kameleo.io), you can easily create multiple virtual browser profiles to work with multiple accounts. It helps you hide your actual timezone, geolocation, language, IP address and creates natural browser fingerprints to prevent detection by anti-bot systems. Kameleo is compatible with [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), and [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) frameworks for automating web scraping tasks. This repository shows useful and easy to understand examples written in Node.js, Python and .NET Core (C#) about web scraping and automated browsing with Kameleo Client.

# Features
- Stay completely undetected, so websites wonâ€™t be able to detect that you are using automation tools
- Start unlimited number of profiles with different natural browser fingerprints
- Use authenticated HTTP/SOCKS/SSH proxies in browsers
- Create isolated browsing environments simultaneously
- Use real browser profiles of Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge
- Edit, Import or Export browser cookies
- Modify WebRTC parameters
- Modify Geolocation settings
- Modify Timezone and Language settings
- Modify WebGL fingerprint
- Modify 2D Canvas fingerprint
